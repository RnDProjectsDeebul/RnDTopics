# RnDTopics


1. Dirichlet uncertainty and its application to Adversarial and OOD detection
    * http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/kopetzki21a/kopetzki21a.pdf
    * https://github.com/TUM-DAML/dbu-robustness
    * Has implementation of all dirichlet uncertaitny estimation methods
    * Good code 

2. Uncertainty estimation 
    * https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS/awesome-uncertainty-deeplearning
    * Differentiation of all different uncertainty estimation methods
    * TOPIC : All methods have been tested on only MNIST and CIFAR
    * NONE HAS TESTED ON IMAGENET

3. Label Noise and Dirichlet uncertatinty
    * https://github.com/subeeshvasu/Awesome-Learning-with-Label-Noise#github
    * Inoder to start this RnD you have to train a neural network with the evidential loss function
    * with any of the noisy label dataset
    * compare performance and if the performance is low .
    * The goal of the RnD is to find the solution
