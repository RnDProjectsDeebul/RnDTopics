# Topics to prepare for RnD

1. Numpy
2. Pandas dataframe
3. Plotting with matplotlib and seaborn
4. Tensor operations

The only way to be sure you know the above topics is to do the exercises of these topics. So google for "numpy exercise" you will get something and do those exercise. (If you find any good exercise please email me I am keeping a list of this. )

The common thing in all topic is the concept of "Thinking in Vectors" . How to formulate any problem in vector(or Tensors for DNN) rather than using "loops" .

This concept is covered in details in this small book "https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy/" available free. The first 4 chapters please read carefully and do it  other chapter take a glimpse.

For getting an idea about DNN and also do practically I will always suggest using the book . https://d2l.ai/
Book is freely available , with code and exercise . We need to understand fully till chapter on CNN.

If you have any doubts regarding anything you or you are not able to understand you can contact me and I will help you understand it
